# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is Router Protocol?

Router Protocol is a cross-chain infrastructure designed to enable seamless communication between blockchains. It serves as the standard infrastructure for state and asset transfer across chains, allowing developers to build truly cross-chain applications.

### How does Router Protocol work?

Router Protocol uses a network of decentralized validators to facilitate cross-chain transactions and messages. When a user initiates a cross-chain action, Router Protocol's validators verify the transaction, reach consensus, and execute the appropriate actions on the destination chain.

### Which blockchains does Router Protocol support?

Router Protocol supports a wide range of EVM and non-EVM blockchains. For a complete list, please see our [Supported Chains](/docs/networks/supported-chains) page.

## Products

### What is Voyager?

Voyager is Router Protocol's next-generation cross-chain bridge that enables users to transfer assets between different blockchains. It offers a seamless user experience with optimal routing and competitive fees.

### What is CrossTalk?

CrossTalk is Router Protocol's cross-chain messaging framework that enables smart contracts on different blockchains to communicate with each other. This allows developers to build truly cross-chain applications.

### What is PathFinder?

PathFinder is Router Protocol's API service that finds the most optimal routes for cross-chain transactions, ensuring the best rates and lowest fees. It analyzes multiple factors to determine the most efficient path for moving assets between blockchains.

## Technical Questions

### How secure is Router Protocol?

Router Protocol prioritizes security with multiple layers of protection:

- Multi-signature validation
- Threshold cryptography
- Regular security audits
- Decentralized validator network
- Bug bounty program

### Can I build my own cross-chain application using Router Protocol?

Yes, Router Protocol provides developers with the tools and infrastructure needed to build cross-chain applications. You can use CrossTalk to enable communication between smart contracts on different blockchains and Voyager to handle asset transfers.

### How can I integrate Router Protocol into my existing application?

Router Protocol offers various SDKs, APIs, and widgets that make integration straightforward. For detailed integration guides, please check our [Developer Documentation](/docs/category/developers).

## Token and Governance

### What is the ROUTE token?

ROUTE is the native utility token of the Router Protocol ecosystem. It is used for:

- Paying transaction fees
- Staking to secure the network
- Participating in governance decisions
- Receiving rewards as a validator

### How can I participate in Router Protocol's governance?

Token holders can participate in governance by:

1. Staking ROUTE tokens
2. Creating governance proposals
3. Voting on active proposals
4. Delegating voting power to other participants
